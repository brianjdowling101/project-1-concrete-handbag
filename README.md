# Concrete Hand Bag

The **Concrete Hand Bag** website is a static HTML and CSS project designed to serve as the official site for the fictional band *Concrete Hand Bag*. This website aims to be an engaging and informative resource for fans, new visitors, and potential event organizers interested in the band’s music, background, and booking information.

Its purpose is to showcase the band's identity, provide access to multimedia content such as band photos and videos, and offer a way to contact the band directly. The site is built using semantic HTML5 and custom CSS3, with an emphasis on accessibility, responsiveness, and clear visual hierarchy.

Whether users are loyal fans or curious newcomers, this website is designed to be intuitive and accessible across all devices.

## Accessibility Improvements

Previously, the website had 11 contrast-related accessibility errors identified by the WAVE accessibility checker. These issues affected text readability, particularly in the dropdown menu and the merch/support sections. 

All 11 contrast issues have now been fully resolved. Text visibility and contrast have been improved across all areas to meet accessibility standards and ensure a better experience for all users.

- Overall, the coding has been going well, but there’s been a bit of a drop in consistency lately. One thing to watch out for the future is image sizing (Example: Banner Image), but it makes a big difference in how things look and work. Keeping an eye on that and moving forward will help keep everything running smoothly and looking sharp!
