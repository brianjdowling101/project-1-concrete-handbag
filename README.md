### Accessibility Improvements

Previously, the website had 11 contrast-related accessibility errors identified by the WAVE accessibility checker. These issues affected text readability, particularly in the dropdown menu and the merch/support sections. 

All 11 contrast issues have now been fully resolved. Text visibility and contrast have been improved across all areas to meet accessibility standards and ensure a better experience for all users.

- Overall, the coding has been going well, but there’s been a bit of a drop in consistency lately. One thing to watch out for the future is image sizing (Example: Banner Image), but it makes a big difference in how things look and work. Keeping an eye on that and moving forward will help keep everything running smoothly and looking sharp!
